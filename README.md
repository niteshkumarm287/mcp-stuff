def get_weather(city: str) -> dict:
    """Gets weather for a city"""
    # Implementation

agent = Agent(
    name="weather_agent",
    tools=[get_weather]
)
```

### **Stage 4B: Research Agent with Google Search**
```python
from google.adk.tools import google_search

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Master each concept before combining
2. **Test Locally**: Use InMemorySessionService for dev
3. **Log Everything**: Build observability from day 1
4. **Iterate**: Each stage should work before moving on
5. **Document**: Write docs as you build
